"""Cross-cutting constants for the subscription plugin.

The vendor money path is DECOUPLED from the central marketplace plugin:
subscription stamps the buyer invoice line's ``extra_data`` with this LOCAL key
under the selling vendor's user id, and ``marketplace`` credits the vendor from
it on ``invoice.paid`` — no plugin ever imports the other. ``VENDOR_ID_KEY`` is
a local copy of the documented ``MARKETPLACE_VENDOR_ID_KEY`` convention, pinned
to the literal by a contract test (DRY without inverting the dependency arrow).
